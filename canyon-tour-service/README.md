This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

Ionic with Angular or React

- User Stories

As a user, I want a nice design look and feel exactly like the one found here(make it look as close as you can to the dribbble design -- except for the exact background image of course, just use one from google): https://dribbble.com/shots/11141145-Travel-service-Mobile-App/attachments/2744149?mode=media

1. As a user, I want to be able to see an overview about the Breathtaking Antelope Canyon Tour, including the price, duration, and a small blurb about the canyon

2. As a user, I want to see the top Review for the Canyon tour

3. As a user, I want to be able to bookmark the Tour

4. As a user, I want to be able to Book the tour Now

5. As a user, I’d like to set pictures from my phone’s gallery as the new picture for the Canyon(i.e. Just have the functionality of uploading a picture and have it show as the picture instead of a canyon picture) 

6. As a user, I want to click the back button in the top left to take me back to a ‘Discover’ page exactly the same as the discover page shown in the link above. ( Do not go overboard in detail on this page. Put the UI there without much functionality. We just want to see how you go about navigation :D)
